# Valentine Page

Simple single-page site that asks "Will you be my valentine?" with two buttons.

How it works
- Hovering the `Yes` button (desktop) or tapping it (mobile) moves it randomly in x,y,z using `translate3d()`.
- Clicking the `No` button shows the message: "thank god! i am safe. thanks"

Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser to try it.

prompt:
i need a website in html, css, js. first page should be a simple page. it should ask a question: will you be my valentine? and there should be 2 buttons yes, no. when hovered on yes, the button should move. it should change its x,y,z. they should be random. but enough so the displacement is prominent. on mobile view, there isnt a cursor, so when yes is clicked, it should act the same (move position). when clicked on no, a msg should be displayed: thank god! i am safe. thanks
