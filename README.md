# Valentine Page

Simple single-page site that asks "Will you be my valentine?" with two buttons.

How it works
- Hovering the `Yes` button (desktop) or tapping it (mobile) moves it randomly in x,y,z using `translate3d()`.
- Clicking the `No` button shows the message: "thank god! i am safe. thanks"

Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser to try it.
